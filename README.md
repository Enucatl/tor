## Description

This module manages tor and is mainly geared towards people running it on
servers. With this module, you should be able to manage most, if not all of
the functionalities provided by tor, such as:

* relays
* bridges and exit nodes
* onion services
* exit policies
* transport plugins

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

This module needs:

 * the [concat module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-concat.git)
 * the [stdlib module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib.git)
 * the [apt module](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt.git)

Explicit dependencies can be found in the project's metadata.json file.

### Getting started

`class { 'tor': }` will install tor with a default configuration. Chances are
you will want to configure Tor in a certain way. This is accomplished declaring
one or more of the `tor::daemon` defined types.

For example, this will configure a tor bridge relay running on port 8080:

``` puppet
  tor::daemon::relay {
    'MyNickname':
      bridge_relay     => true,
      port             => 8080,
      address          => '1.1.1.1',
      bandwidth_rate   => 12500,
      bandwidth_burst  => 12500,
      contact_info     => 'Foo Bar <foo@bar.com>',
  }
```

There are many more such snippets available in `tor::daemon`, for
example, this will create a hidden service for the SSH daemon:

``` puppet
tor::daemon::onion_service { 'onion-ssh':
    ports => [ '22' ],
}
```

See the `manifests/daemon` directory for more examples.

# Functions

This module comes with functions specific to tor support. They require the
base32, ed25519 and sha3 gem to be installed on the master or wherever they are
executed. For JRuby based installations such as puppetserver environments you
can use the sha3-pure-ruby instead of the C based library.

## onionv3_key

This functions generates an onion v3 key pair if not already existing. As
arguments, you need to pass a base directory and an indentifier (name) of the key.
The key pair will be looked up in a directory under <base_dir>/<name>.

As a result you will get a hash containing they secret key (hs_ed25519_secret_key),
the public key (hs_ed25519_public_key) and the onion hostname (hostname). The
latter will be without the `.onion` suffix.

If a key has already been created and exists under that directory, the content
of these files will be returned.

Note that an easier way to use this function is to call
`tor::daemon::onion_service` instead, as that will also take care of
adding configuration to the Tor daemon.

# Facts

## tor_hidden_services

This fact gives you a list of the hidden services you are running.
